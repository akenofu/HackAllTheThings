-   Identify the cause of the error.
    -   If the user entered an invalid value, specify the invalid value.
    -   Specify requirements and constraints, such as required permissions or minimum RAM.
-   Explain to fix the problem.
    -   When appropriate, provide an example to help demonstrate the fix.
-   Write clearly.
    -   Be concise, not wordy. However, don't be so concise that the resulting error message becomes cryptic.
    -   Avoid double negatives and exceptions to exceptions.
    -   Aim the message at the appropriate target audience. Words appropriate for software engineers are often inappropriate for non-technical users.
    -   Use terminology consistently. For example, don't use the term _directory_ in one part of an error message and a _folder_ in another part.
    -   Format long error messages carefully, possibly using progressive disclosure or links to expanded documentation.
    -   Set a positive tone.
    -   Don't be overly apologetic.
