Writing good documentation is an iterative process. I recommend cross-referecing the basics with your document. Afterwards, consider moving towards the intermediate and miscellaneous sections.

## Basic
-   Use terms consistently.
-   Avoid ambiguous pronouns.
-   Prefer active voice to passive voice.
-   Pick specific verbs over vague ones.
-   Focus each sentence on a single idea.
-   Convert some long sentences to lists.
-   Eliminate unneeded words.
-   Use a numbered list when ordering is important and a bulleted list when ordering is irrelevant.
-   Keep list items parallel.
-   Start numbered list items with imperative words.
-   Introduce lists and tables appropriately.
-   Create great opening sentences that establish a paragraph's central point.
-   Focus each paragraph on a single topic.
-   Determine what your audience needs to learn.
-   Fit documentation to your audience.
-   Establish your document's key points at the start of the document.


## Intermediate
-   Adopt a style guide.
-   Think like your audience.
-   Read documents out loud (to yourself).
-   Return to documents well after you've written the draft.
-   Find a good peer editor.
-   Outline a document. Alternatively, write free form and then organize.
-   Introduce a document's scope and any prerequisites.
-   Prefer task-based headings.
-   Disclose information progressively (in some situations).
-   Consider writing the caption _before_ creating the illustration.
-   Constrain the amount of information in a single drawing.
-   Focus the reader's attention on the relevant part of a picture or diagram by describing the takeaway in the caption or by adding a visual cue to the picture.
-   Create concise sample code that is easy to understand.
-   Keep code comments short, but prefer clarity over brevity.
-   Avoid writing comments about _obvious_ code.
-   Focus your commenting energy on anything non-intuitive in the code.
-   Provide not only examples but also anti-examples.
-   Provide code samples that demonstrate a range of complexity.
-   Make a practice of continuous revision.
-   Provide different documentation types for different categories of users.
-   Compare and contrast with something that readers are already familiar with.
-   In tutorials, reinforce concepts with examples.
-   In tutorials, note problems that readers may encounter.


## Cyber Security related
- Replace "the attacker" with "threat actor"
- Don't refer to yourself in first person; Use company's name.
- The company is an entity. Use they to refer to the company
