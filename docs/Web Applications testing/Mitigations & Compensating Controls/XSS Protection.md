## Application Specific Controls
### X-XSS-Protection
The HTTP **`X-XSS-Protection`** response header is a feature of Internet Explorer, Chrome and Safari that stops pages from loading when they detect reflected cross-site scripting ([XSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting)) attacks. Although these protections are largely unnecessary in modern browsers when sites implement a strong [`Content-Security-Policy`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy) that disables the use of inline JavaScript (`'unsafe-inline'`), they can still provide protections for users of older web browsers that don't yet support [CSP](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/CSP).

-   Chrome has [removed their XSS Auditor](https://www.chromestatus.com/feature/5021976655560704)
-   Firefox has not, and [will not implement `X-XSS-Protection`](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=528661)
-   Edge has [retired their XSS filter](https://blogs.windows.com/windowsexperience/2018/07/25/announcing-windows-10-insider-preview-build-17723-and-build-18204/)

`0`: Disables XSS filtering.
`1`: Enables XSS filtering (usually default in browsers). If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page (remove the unsafe parts).
`1; mode=block`: Enables XSS filtering. Rather than sanitizing the page, the browser will prevent rendering of the page if an attack is detected.
`1; report=<reporting-URI> (Chromium only)`: Enables XSS filtering. If a cross-site scripting attack is detected, the browser will sanitize the page and report the violation. This uses the functionality of the CSP [`report-uri`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Headers/Content-Security-Policy/report-uri) directive to send a report.

### Content Security Policy
The CSP uses a collection of directives in order to define a specific set of whitelisted sources of trusted content. 
It instructs the browser to only execute or render resources from the allowed sources.

Directives work in default-allow mode. This simply means that if a specific directive does not have a policy defined, then it is equal to `*`; thus, every source is a valid source.
The  `X-Content-Security-Policy`, `Content-Security-Policy` and `X-WebKit-CSP`. 

To both avoid this type of behavior and define a common rule for all the directives unset, the specification provides the `default-src` directive. Clearly, it will be applied to all the unspecified directives. 

Apply to all the unspecified directives
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

Only execute or render resources from the allowed sources.
`Content-Security-Policy: script-src 'self' https://other.web.site`

Define a common rule for all the directives unset
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'`

Deny resources
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src https://my.web.site; object-src 'none'; frame-src 'none'`

`none` - no sources
`self` - current origin, but not its subdomains
`unsafe-inline` - allows inline JavaScript and CSS
`unsafe-evalوeval, alert, setTimeout, ...` - allows text-to-JavaScript sinks like 

Report violations to specific location
`Content-Security-Policy: default-src 'self'; report-uri /csp_report;`

```json
{
	"csp-report": {
	"document-uri": "http://my.web.site/page.html",
	"referrer": "http://hacker.site/",
	"blocked-uri": "http://hacker.site/xss_test.js",
	"violated-directive": "script-src 'self',
	"original-policy": "script-src 'self'; report-uri
	http://my.web.site/csp_report"
	}
}
```

> Once a violation is detected, the browser will perform a POST request to the path specified, sending a JSON object, similar to the one on the next slide.
