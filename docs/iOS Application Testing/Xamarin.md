### Steps
1. Follow the steps in the [How To Capture Non-Proxy Aware Mobile Application Traffic (IOS & Android) Xamarin/Flutter -Pentesting | by salman syed | Medium](https://slmnsd552.medium.com/how-to-capture-non-proxy-aware-mobile-application-traffic-ios-android-xamarin-flutter-924fe044facf) blog to set up OpenVPN.
> Ensure OpenVPN is set to use TCP
3. Delete all `iptable` rules, refer to [iptables(8) - Linux man page (die.net)](https://linux.die.net/man/8/iptables) for full context.
```bash
# Flush filter rules i.e: FOWARD, INPUT, OUTPUT
iptables -F

# Allow all inbound traffic
sudo iptables -P INPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P OUTPUT ACCEPT
sudo iptables -P FORWARD ACCEPT

# [optional] Get NAT rule number
sudo iptables -t nat -v -L -n --line-number

# [optional] Flush nat rule i.e: PREROUTING, POSTROUTING
sudo iptables -t nat -D PREROUTING <rule_number>
```
3. Route traffic from your VPN interface and redirect to your host (Burp Suite)
```bash
# To forward to local port 8888 
iptables -t nat -A PREROUTING -i tun0 -p tcp --dport 443 -j REDIRECT --to-port 8888 

# [optional] if you delete OpenVPN's NATing rule by accident, restore it with
sudo iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -s 10.8.0.0/24 -o ens33 -j MASQUERADE # , where ens33 is the interface connected to the internet
```
4. Enable IP Forwarding
```bash
# Enable
sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1

# [optional] Validate it works
cat /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward
```
> If you don't see traffic in Burp, checkout Burp's Dashboard - sometimes it's an SSL pinning issue.

### Bypass SSL pinning
- Login to the application without intercepting the traffic
- Download Burp Certificate by navigating to `http://burp:8080`. 
- Find the Bundle path on the device using objection
	![](/Screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020230804155041.png)
- Find the certificate using `find` and `grep`
	```bash
	find . | grep -E "cer|der"
	```
	![](/Screenshots/Pasted%20image%2020230804155700.png)
- Replace the certificate with Burp's certificate. You may need to convert `der` certificate format to `.cer`. To do so, follow this blog: [Install Burpsuiteâ€™s or any CA certificate to system store in Android 10,11 and Kali linux. | by n00ðŸ”‘ | Medium](https://pswalia2u.medium.com/install-burpsuites-or-any-ca-certificate-to-system-store-in-android-10-and-11-38e508a5541a)
