## Code Snippets
```cypher
// Delete all nodes with their chil nodes
MATCH (n)
DETACH DELETE n


// LOAD CSV file and parse it
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///NSGs.csv' AS line
MERGE (src: host { host:  line.Source } )
MERGE (dst: host { host:  line.Destination } )
MERGE (dst) - [:HAS_PORT] -> (port: port { portNum: line.Destination_Port } )
MERGE (src) - [ALLOW:ALLOW {ALLOW: "ALLOW"} ] -> (port)  

// Alternatively
LOAD CSV WITH HEADERS FROM 'file:///NSGs.csv' AS line
MERGE (srcHost: srcHost { host:  line.Source_Name } )
MERGE (dstHost: dstHost { host:  line.Destination } )
MERGE (srcHost) - [PORT: ALLOW { dstPort: line.Destination_Port }  ] -> (dstHost)
																		 

// Get Graph Representation
WITH *
Match (n)
return n
