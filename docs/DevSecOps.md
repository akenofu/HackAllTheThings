### CI/CD Hardening
#### CICD-SEC-1: Insufficient Flow Control Mechanisms

Map your attack premieter. I recommend threat modelling your CI/CD pipleine - just like you would any other highlevel system.
- Can internal malicious actors push code and trigger the build pipeline?
- Automerging code to production if it meets certain rules?
- Can artifacts, libraries or build dependencies be used to execute code?
- Can pipeline code be modified and executed?

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure no single person can push code and deploy it simultaneously. Ensure at least one or more reviewer is needed before code is pushed and build. 

#### CICD-SEC-2: Inadequate Identity and Access Management 

Identities should not be:

- Overly permission: principle of least privilege
- Stale (not used)
- Local: these are hard to manage and secure
- External: the security premieter is shared with other organizations, as the current organization rules are not enforced on them.
- Self-registered: hard to keep track and enforce rules
- Shared between programmatic context and human users

**Recommendations:**
- For all identities in the system map the identity provider, level of permissions granted and level of permissions actually used
- Disable/Remove any identity which has surpassed the predetermined period of inactivity.
- Create dedicated accounts for each specific context
- Prevent employees from using any address not owned by the organization

#### CICD-SEC-3: Dependency Chain Abuse
The main attack vectors:

- Dependency confusion 
- Dependency hijacking 
- Typosquatting
- Brandjacking 

**Recommendations:**
- Whenever 3rd party packages are pulled from an external repository, ensure all packages are pulled through an internal proxy
- Disallow pulling of packages directly from external repositories. Configure all clients to pull packages from internal repositories
-   Enable checksum verification and signature verification for pulled packages.
- Prefer configuring a pre-vetted version or version ranges
